# Full Stack Coding Challenge

A simple home address search that returns matching houses from a large set of
houses â€“ think Zillow but without the map. The frontend that allows for user
input to search and see results from that search. The backend which contains one
endpoint that filters the homes from the search query and returns matching homes
from the csv file provided.
